# Review the Chapter Web Application

In this module we'll take some time to review the Chapter Web Application for this phase of the program. The course uses project-based learning, which is one of the most effective ways to learn a new skill. The reason why this technique works so well is because you'll get a chance to look at a completed project that was built using all of the fundamentals taught in this phase of the program; this way you can see a solid example we'll use to reverse engineer and break apart in order to learn all of the individual concepts.

**By the end of this lesson, students are expected to:**
- Acquire insight on what they're expected to learn in this phase of the program.
- See an example of a typical file system for a simple web application. 
- See an example of all three web technologies (HTML, CSS & JavaScript), and how they work together

**Roadmap:**

- The Project Filesystem
- The Content Structure of the Project
- The Styling of the Project
- The Application Logic of the Project

## The Project Filesystem

For this project, you'll notice that it's made up of one folder, which we commonly refer to as a directory or root directory; this is like a container for the project's files.
